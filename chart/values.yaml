# securityContext:
## Whether the container should be run in "Privileged" mode (essentially, root on the host)
## Ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1/definitions/#_v1_securitycontext
## Default: false

Service:
  ## What scope the service should be exposed in. One of:
  ## - LoadBalancer (to the world)
  ## - ClusterIP (to the cluster)
  ## - NodePort (to the world, in a custom way)
  Type: "LoadBalancer"
  ## If there is a port associated with a given service, expose it here.
  # Port:
  ## If there is a particular IP that should be used for the service, specify it here.
  ## Note: It's quite unlikely that an IP should be specific. Normally, the best thing to do is leave it to Kubernetes
  ##       to allocate a free IP from the pool.
  ## Default: Automatically assign a random IP
  # privateIp:
  ## Only relevant if the `type` above is "LoadBalancer"
  LoadBalancer:
    ## If there is already a reserved public IP that this load balancer should use, indicate it here.
    ## Default: Automatically assign a random, ephemeral IP
    # publicIp:
    ## If there should be firewall rules restricting the load balancer to a limited set of IPs, specify those IPs below
    ## in CIDR format. If all IPs shoud be allowed access, set the CIDR as "0.0.0.0/0"
    AllowedIps:
      - "0.0.0.0/0"
    ## If there is a Hostname associated with this site, add it here and it will be rendered in the documentation.

## Configuration to enable the easy provisioning of certificates with kube-cert-manager and a Boulder compatible CA
Certificate:
  Domain: "www.example.com"
  Email: "user@example.com"
  ## Consult the Kube cert manager docs for information on how to build this
  Provider: "GoogleCloud"

Monitoring:
  ## Whether to scrape this service with the montoring toolkit. Mostly useful for blackbox probing of a given service
  ## to ensure it's "up"
  Service:
    Scrape: "true"
  ## Whether to scape the pods associated with this application. Useful for collecting metrics.
  Pod:
    ## Monitoring shoudl be configured to only scrape pods that have a value of `true`
    Scrape: "true"
    ## Path on which metrics are exposed
    Path: "/metrics"
    ## Port on which HTTP server is served
    Port: "9102"
